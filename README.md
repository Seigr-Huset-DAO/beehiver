# About BeehiveR

⚠️The app is still in early development stage.

BeehiveR is an open source project for small scala beekeepers. With this app beekeepers can keep a log of their beehives and access information about other beehives. All information gathered is open and accessible to registered beekeepers. All registered beekeepers will also be able to ask for advice to the community.

## Seigr Huset DAO
